# ChatPolly

A chatbot built by ChatGPT. I have chatgpt plus and I built this app using GPT3.5.

## Prerequisite 

Use either of the commands
```
pip3 install Flask
pip3 install openai
pip3 install boto3
```

Now set OpenAI API key as an environment variable
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```
and 
```
. ~/.zshrc
```

## To run the demo

```
python app.py
```

## TODOs
I wanted to add audio input and audio output. My goal is to make it like human to human chat experience where you talk and listen.
